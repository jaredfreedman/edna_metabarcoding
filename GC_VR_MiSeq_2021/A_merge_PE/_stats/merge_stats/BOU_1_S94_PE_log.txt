Merging reads 100%
    140743  Pairs
    131608  Merged (93.5%)
      9135  Not merged (6.5%)

Pairs that failed merging due to various reasons:
        39  too few kmers found on same diagonal
         1  multiple potential alignments
      9093  alignment score too low, or score drop too high
         2  overlap too short
