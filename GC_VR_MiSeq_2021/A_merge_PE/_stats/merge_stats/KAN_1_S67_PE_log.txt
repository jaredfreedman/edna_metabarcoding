Merging reads 100%
    116006  Pairs
    108567  Merged (93.6%)
      7439  Not merged (6.4%)

Pairs that failed merging due to various reasons:
        20  too few kmers found on same diagonal
         2  multiple potential alignments
      7416  alignment score too low, or score drop too high
         1  overlap too short
