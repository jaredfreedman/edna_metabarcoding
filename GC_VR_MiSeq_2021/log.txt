OTU table generated (including OTU sequences): 3_Raw_OTU_table.csv
OTU files are written also as fasta file in 3_Raw_OTU.fasta
Discarding OTUs with below 0.01% abundance across at least 1 out of 95 samples.
Discarded OTUs: 519 out of 1932 discarded (26.86%)


Remapping 93 files (incl. singletons) against subsetted OTUs "J_Cluster_otus/_data/5_subset/5_OTU_sub_0.01.fasta" using "usearch_global" using id=0.97.
